  <t>This memo describes a data structure called "S-expressions" that
  are suitable for representing arbitrary, complex data structures.  We
  make precise the encodings of S-expressions: we give a "canonical
  form" for S-expressions, described two "transport" representations,
  and also describe an "advanced" format for display to people.</t>

<section> <!-- 1. -->
  <name>Introduction</name>

  <t>S-expressions are data structures for representing complex data.
  They are either byte-strings ("octet-strings") or lists of simpler
  S-expressions.  Here is a sample S-expression:</t>

<sourcecode>
    (snicker "abc" (#03# |YWJj|))
</sourcecode>

<t>It is a list of length three: </t>

<ul>
  <li>the octet-string "snicker"</li>

  <li>the octet-string "abc"</li>

  <li>a sub-list containing two elements: the hexadecimal constant
  #03# and the base-64 constant |YWJj| (which is the same as
  "abc")</li>
</ul>

  <t>This note gives a specific proposal for constructing and
  utilizing S-expressions.  The proposal is independent of any
  particular application.</t>

  <dl>

<dt>Here are the design goals for S-expressions:</dt><dd></dd>

<dt>generality:</dt><dd>S-expressions should be good at representing
arbitrary data.</dd>

<dt>readability:</dt><dd>it should be easy for someone to examine and
understand the structure of an S-expression.</dd>

<dt>economy:</dt><dd>S-expressions should represent data compactly.</dd>

<dt>tranportability:</dt><dd>S-expressions should be easy to transport
over communication media (such as email) that are known to be less
than perfect.</dd>

<dt>flexibility:</dt><dd>S-expressions should make it relatively
simple to modify and extend data structures.</dd>

<dt>canonicalization:</dt><dd>it should be easy to produce a unique
"canonical" form of an S-expression, for digital signature purposes.</dd>

<dt>efficiency:</dt><dd>S-expressions should admit in-memory
representations that allow efficient processing.</dd>

  <name>Historical Notes</name>

<t>The S-expression technology described here was originally developed
for "SDSI" (the Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure by Lampson
and Rivest <xref target="SDSI"/>) in 1996, although the origins
clearly date back to McCarthy's <xref target="LISP"/> programming
language.  It was further refined and improved during the merger of
SDSI and SPKI <xref target="SPKI"/> <xref target="RFC2692"/> <xref
target="RFC2693"/> during the first half of 1997.  S-expressions are
similar to, but more readable and flexible than, Bernstein's
"net-strings" <xref target="BERN"/>.</t>

<t>Although made publicly available as a file named
draft-rivest-sexp-00.txt on 4 May 1997, this document was not actually
submitted to the IETF as that time. Version -00 of this document was a
modernized version of that file. Version -01 had some further
polishing and corrections. The further significant changes made in
this document were changing the original BNF notation to ABNF <xref
target="RFC5234"/> (see <xref target="ABNF"/>) and changing the
default character set in <xref target="DisplayHint"/> to UTF-8 <xref
target="RFC4648"/>.</t>

  <name>Conventions Used in This Document</name>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only
when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

  <name>S-expressions -- informal introduction</name>

  <t>Informally, an S-expression is either:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
  <li>an octet-string, or</li>
  <li>a finite list of simpler S-expressions.</li>
</ul>

<t>An octet-string is a finite sequence of eight-bit octets.  There
may be many different but equivalent ways of representing an
octet-string</t>

<sourcecode>
    abc         -- as a token
    "abc"       -- as a quoted string
    #616263#    -- as a hexadecimal string
    3:abc       -- as a length-prefixed "verbatim" encoding
    {MzphYmM=}  -- as a base-64 encoding of the verbatim
                     encoding (that is, an encoding of "3:abc")
    |YWJj|      -- as a base-64 encoding of the octet-string
                     "abc"
</sourcecode>

<t>The above encodings are all equivalent; they all denote the same
octet string.</t>

<t>We will give details of these encodings later on, and also describe
how to give a "display type" to a simple string.</t>

<t>A list is a finite sequence of zero or more simpler S-expressions.
A list is represented by using parentheses to surround the sequence of
encodings of its elements, as in:</t>

<sourcecode>
    (abc (de #6667#) "ghi jkl")
</sourcecode>

<t>As we see, there is variability possible in the encoding of an
S-expression.  In some cases, it is desirable to standardize or
restrict the encodings; in other cases it is desirable to have no
restrictions.  The following are the target cases we aim to
handle:</t>

<ul>

  <li>a "transport" or "basic" encoding for transporting the
  S-expression between computers.</li>

  <li>a "canonical" encoding, used when signing the
  S-expression.</li>

  <li>an "advanced" encoding used for input/output to people.</li>

  <li>an "in-memory" encoding used for processing the S-expression
  in the computer.</li>

</ul>

<t>These need not be different; in this proposal the canonical encoding
is the same as the transport encoding, for example.  In this note we
propose (related) encoding techniques for each of these uses.</t>

</section>

<section>  <!-- 3. -->
  <name>Character set</name>

<t>We will be describing encodings of S-expressions.  Except when giving
"verbatim" encodings, the character set used is limited to the following
characters in US-ASCII:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">

  <dt>Alphabetic:</dt><dd>
  <sourcecode>
    A B ... Z a b ... z
  </sourcecode></dd>

  <dt>numeric:</dt><dd>
  <sourcecode>
    0 1 ... 9
  </sourcecode></dd>

  <dt>whitespace:</dt><dd>
  <sourcecode>
    space, horizontal tab, vertical tab, form-feed
    carriage-return, line-feed
  </sourcecode></dd>

  <dt>The following graphics characters, which we call
  "pseudo-alphabetic":</dt><dd>
<sourcecode>
    - hyphen or minus
    . period
    / slash
    _ underscore
    : colon
    * asterisk
    + plus
    = equal
</sourcecode>
  </dd>

<dt>The following graphics characters, which are "reserved
  punctuation":</dt><dd>
<sourcecode> <![CDATA[
    ( left parenthesis
    ) right parenthesis
    [ left bracket
    ] right bracket
    { left brace
    } right brace
    | vertical bar
    # number sign
    " double quote
    & ampersand
    \ backslash
]]> </sourcecode>
  </dd>

  <dt>The following characters are unused and unavailable, except in
        "verbatim" and "quoted string" encodings:</dt><dd>
<sourcecode> <![CDATA[
    ! exclamation point
    % percent
    ^ circumflex
    ~ tilde
    ; semicolon
    ' apostrophe
    , comma
    < less than
    > greater than
    ? question mark
]]> </sourcecode>
  </dd>

</dl>

<section>  <!-- 4. -->
  <name>Octet string representations</name>

<t>This section describes in detail the ways in which an octet-string may
be represented.</t>

<t>We recall that an octet-string is any finite sequence of octets, and
that the octet-string may have length zero.</t>

  <section>  <!-- 4.1 -->
    <name>Verbatim representation</name>

<t>A verbatim encoding of an octet string consists of three parts:</t>

<ul>

  <li>the length (number of octets) of the octet-string, given in
  decimal, most significant digit first, with no leading zeros.</li>

  <li>a colon ":"</li>

  <li>the octet string itself, verbatim.</li>

</ul>

<t>There are no blanks or whitespace separating the parts.  No "escape
sequences" are interpreted in the octet string.  This encoding is also
called a "binary" or "raw" encoding.</t>

<t>Here are some sample verbatim encodings:</t>

<sourcecode>
    3:abc
    7:subject
    4:::::
    12:hello world!
    10:abcdefghij
    0:
</sourcecode>

</section> <!-- 4.1 -->

<section>  <!-- 4.2 -->
  <name>Quoted-string representation</name>

<t>The quoted-string representation of an octet-string consists of:</t>

<ul>

  <li>an optional decimal length field</li>

  <li>an initial double-quote (")</li>

  <li>the octet string with "C" escape conventions (\n, etc)</li>

  <li>a final double-quote (")</li>

</ul>

<t>The specified length is the length of the resulting string after any
escape sequences have been handled.  The string does not have any
"terminating NULL" that C includes, and the length does not count such
a character.</t>

<t>The length is optional.</t>

<t>The escape conventions within the quoted string are as follows
(these follow the "C" programming language conventions, with an
extension for ignoring line terminators of just LF or CRLF and more
restrictive octal and hexadecimal value formats):</t>

<sourcecode>
    \a     -- audible alert (bell)
    \b     -- backspace
    \t     -- horizontal tab
    \v     -- vertical tab
    \n     -- new-line
    \f     -- form-feed
    \r     -- carriage-return
    \"     -- double-quote
    \'     -- single-quote
    \?     -- question mark
    \\     -- back-slash
    \ooo   -- character with octal value ooo (all three
              digits MUST be present)
    \xhh   -- character with hexadecimal value hh (both
              digits MUST be present)
    \&lt;carriage-return&gt;   -- causes carriage-return
              to be ignored.
    \&lt;line-feed&gt;         -- causes linefeed to be
              ignored.
    \&lt;carriage-return&gt;&lt;line-feed&gt;   -- causes
              CRLF to be ignored.
    \&lt;line-feed&gt;&lt;carriage-return&gt;   -- causes
              LFCR to be ignored.
</sourcecode>

<t>Here are some examples of quoted-string encodings:</t>

<sourcecode>
    "subject"
    "hi there"
    7"subject"
    3"\n\n\n"
    "This has\n two lines."
    "This has \
     one."
    ""
</sourcecode>

</section> <!-- 4.2 -->

<section> <!-- 4.3 -->
  <name>Token representation</name>

<t>An octet string that meets the following conditions may be given
directly as a "token".</t>

<ul>

  <li>it does not begin with a digit</li>

  <li>it contains only characters that are: alphabetic (upper or lower
  case); numeric; or one of the eight "pseudo-alphabetic" punctuation
  marks:</li>
</ul>
<sourcecode>        -   .   /   _   :  *  +  =</sourcecode>

<t>(Note: upper and lower case are not equivalent.)</t>
<t>(Note: A token may begin with punctuation, including ":").</t>

<t>Here are some examples of token representations:</t>

<sourcecode>
    subject
    not-before
    class-of-1997
    //microsoft.com/names/smith
    *
</sourcecode>

</section>  <!-- 4.3 -->

<section>  <!-- 4.4 -->
  <name>Hexadecimal representation</name>

<t>An octet-string may be represented with a hexadecimal encoding
consisting of:</t>

<ul>

  <li>an (optional) decimal length of the octet string</li>

  <li>a  sharp-sign "#"</li>

  <li>a hexadecimal encoding of the octet string, with each octet
  represented with two hexadecimal digits, most significant digit
  first. There MUST be an even number of such digits.</li>

  <li>a sharp-sign "#"</li>

</ul>

<t>There may be whitespace inserted in the midst of the hexadecimal
encoding arbitrarily; it is ignored.  It is an error to have
characters other than whitespace and hexadecimal digits.</t>

<t>Here are some examples of hexadecimal encodings:</t>

<sourcecode>
    #616263#    -- represents "abc"
    3#616263#   -- also represents "abc"
    # 616
      263 #     -- also represents "abc"
</sourcecode>

</section>  <!-- 4.4 -->

<section>  <!-- 4.5 -->
  <name>Base-64 representation</name>

<t>An octet-string may be represented in a base-64 coding <xref
target="RFC4648"/> consisting of:</t>

<ul>
<li>an (optional) decimal length of the octet string</li>

<li>a vertical bar "|"</li>

<li>the base-64 <xref target="RFC4648"/> encoding of the octet
string.</li>

<li>a final vertical bar "|"</li>
</ul>

<t>The base-64 encoding uses only the characters </t>

<sourcecode>
    A-Z  a-z  0-9  +  /  =
</sourcecode>

<t>It produces four characters of output for each three octets of input.
If the input has one or two left-over octets of input, it produces an
output block of length four ending in two or one equals signs, respectively.
Output routines compliant with this standard MUST output the equals signs
as specified.  Input routines MAY accept inputs where the equals signs are
dropped.</t>

<t>There may be whitespace inserted in the midst of the base-64 encoding
arbitrarily; it is ignored.  It is an error to have characters other
than whitespace and base-64 characters.</t>

<t>Here are some examples of base-64 encodings:</t>

<sourcecode>
    |YWJj|       -- represents "abc"
    | Y W
      J j |      -- also represents "abc"
    3|YWJj|      -- also represents "abc"
    |YWJjZA==|   -- represents "abcd"
    |YWJjZA|     -- also represents "abcd"
</sourcecode>

</section>  <!-- 4.5 -->

<section anchor="DisplayHint">  <!-- 4.6 -->
  <name>Display hint</name>

<t>Any octet string may be preceded by a single "display hint".</t>

<t>The purposes of the display hint is to provide information on how
to display the octet string to a user.  It has no other function.
Many of the MIME <xref target="RFC2046"/> types work here.</t>

<t>A display-hint is an octet string surrounded by square brackets.
There may be whitespace separating the octet string from the
surrounding brackets.  Any of the legal formats may be used for the
octet string.</t>

<t>Here are some examples of display-hints:</t>

<sourcecode>
    [image/gif]
    [URI]
    [charset=unicode-1-1]
    [text/richtext]
    [application/postscript]
    [audio/basic]
    ["http://abc.com/display-types/funky.html"]
</sourcecode>

<t>In applications an octet-string that is untyped may be considered
to have a pre-specified "default" MIME <xref target="RFC2046"/> type.
The MIME type</t>

<sourcecode>
    "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
</sourcecode>

<t>is the standard default.</t>

</section>  <!-- 4.6 -->

<section>  <!-- 4.7 -->
  <name>Equality of octet-strings</name>

<t>Two octet strings are considered to be "equal" if and only if they
have the same display hint and the same data octet strings.</t>

<t>Note that octet-strings are "case-sensitive"; the octet-string "abc"
is not equal to the octet-string "ABC".</t>

<t>An untyped octet-string can be compared to another octet-string (typed
or not) by considering it as a typed octet-string with the default
mime-type specified in <xref target="DisplayHint"/> .</t>

</section>  <!-- 4.7 -->

</section>  <!-- 4. -->

<section> <!-- 5. -->
  <name>Lists</name>

<t>Just as with octet-strings, there are several ways to represent an
S-expression.  Whitespace may be used to separate list elements, but
they are only required to separate two octet strings when otherwise
the two octet strings might be interpreted as one, as when one token
follows another.  Also, whitespace may follow the initial left
parenthesis, or precede the final right parenthesis.</t>

<t>Here are some examples of encodings of lists:</t>

<sourcecode>
    (a b c)

    ( a ( b c ) ( ( d e ) ( e f ) )  )

    (11:certificate(6:issuer3:bob)(7:subject5:alice))

    ({ODpFeGFtcGxlIQ==} "1997" murphy 3:XC+)
</sourcecode>

</section>

<section>  <!-- 6. -->
  <name>Representation types</name>

<t>There are three "types" of representations: </t>

<ul>
<li>canonical</li>

<li>basic transport</li>

<li>advanced transport</li>
</ul>

<t>
The first two MUST be supported by any implementation; the last is
OPTIONAL.</t>

<section anchor="canonical">  <!-- 6.1 -->
  <name>Canonical representation</name>

<t>This canonical representation is used for digital signature
purposes, transmission, etc.  It is uniquely defined for each
S-expression.  It is not particularly readable, but that is not the
point.  It is intended to be very easy to parse, to be reasonably
economical, and to be unique for any S-expression.</t>

<t>The "canonical" form of an S-expression represents each
octet-string in verbatim mode, and represents each list with no blanks
separating elements from each other or from the surrounding
parentheses.</t>

<t>Here are some examples of canonical representations of
S-expressions:</t>

<sourcecode>
    (6:issuer3:bob)

    (4:icon[12:image/bitmap]9:xxxxxxxxx)

    (7:subject(3:ref5:alice6:mother))
</sourcecode>

</section>

<section>  <!-- 6.2 -->
  <name>Basic transport representation</name>

<t>There are two forms of the "basic transport" representation:</t>

<ul>
  <li>the canonical representation</li>

  <li>an <xref target="RFC4648"/> base-64 representation of the canonical
  representation, surrounded by braces.</li>
</ul>

<t>The transport mechanism is intended to provide a universal means of
representing S-expressions for transport from one machine to
another.</t>

<t>Here are some examples of an S-expression represented in basic
transport mode:</t>

<sourcecode>
    (1:a1:b1:c)

    {KDE6YTE6YjE6YykK}
</sourcecode>

<t>The second example above is the same S-expression as the first
encoded in base-64.</t>

<t>There is a difference between the brace notation for base-64 used
here and the || notation for base-64'd octet-strings described above.
Here the base-64 contents are converted to octets, and then re-scanned
as if they were given originally as octets.  With the || notation, the
contents are just turned into an octet-string.</t>

</section>

<section>  <!-- 6.3 -->
  <name>Advanced transport representation</name>

<t>The "advanced transport" representation is intended to provide more
flexible and readable notations for documentation, design, debugging,
and (in some cases) user interface.</t>

<t>The advanced transport representation allows all of the
representation forms described above in Section 4, include quoted
strings, base-64 and hexadecimal representation of strings, tokens,
representations of strings with omitted lengths, and so on.</t>

</section>

</section>  <!-- 6. -->

<section anchor="ABNF">  <!-- 7. -->
  <name>ABNF for syntax</name>

<t>ABNF is the Augmented Backus-Naur Form for syntax specifications as
defined in <xref target="RFC5234"/>. We give separate ABNF's for
canonical, basic, and advanced forms of S-expressions.  The rules
below in all caps are defined in Appendix A of <xref
target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

<t>For canonical transport:</t>

<sourcecode> <![CDATA[

raw      =  decimal ":" *OCTET
               ; the length followed by a colon and the exact
               ;  number of OCTET indicated by the length

decimal  =  %x30 / (%x31-39 *DIGIT)

<t>For basic transport:</t>

  <name>In-memory representations</name>

<t>For processing, the S-expression would typically be parsed and
represented in memory in a way that is more amenable to efficient
processing.  We suggest two alternatives:</t>

<ul>
<li>"list-structure"</li>

<li>"array-layout"</li>
</ul>

<t>We only sketch these here, as they are only suggestive.  The code
referenced below illustrates these styles in more detail.</t>

<section>  <!-- 8.1 -->
  <name>List-structure memory representation</name>

<t>Here there are separate records for simple-strings, strings, and
lists.  An S-expression of the form ("abc" "de") would require two
records for the simple strings, two for the strings, and two for the
list elements.  This is a fairly conventional representation, and
details are omitted here.</t>

</section>

<section>  <!-- 8.2 -->
  <name>Array-layout memory representation</name>

<t>Here each S-expression is represented as a contiguous array of bytes.
The first byte codes the "type" of the S-expression:</t>

<sourcecode>
    01   octet-string

    02   octet-string with display-hint

    03   beginning of list (and 00 is used for "end of list")
</sourcecode>

<t>Each of the three types is immediately followed by a k-byte integer
indicating the size (in bytes) of the following representation.  Here
k is an integer that depends on the implementation, it might be
anywhere from 2 to 8, but would be fixed for a given implementation;
it determines the size of the objects that can be handled.  The
transport and canonical representations are independent of the choice
of k made by the implementation.</t>

<t>Although the length of lists are not given in the usual
S-expression notations, it is easy to fill them in when parsing; when
you reach a right-parenthesis you know how long the list
representation was, and where to go back to fill in the missing
length.</t>

<section>  <!-- 8.2.1 -->
  <name>Octet string</name>

<t>This is represented as follows:</t>

<sourcecode> <![CDATA[
    01 <length> <octet-string>
]]> </sourcecode>

<t>For example (here k = 2)</t>

<sourcecode>
    01 0003 a b c
</sourcecode>

</section>

<section>  <!-- 8.2.2 -->
  <name>Octet-string with display-hint</name>

<t>This is represented as follows:</t>

<sourcecode> <![CDATA[
    02 <length>
      01 <length> <octet-string>    /* for display-type */
      01 <length> <octet-string>    /* for octet-string */
]]> </sourcecode>

<t>For example, the S-expression </t>

<sourcecode>
    [gif] #61626364#
</sourcecode>

<t>would be represented as (with k = 2)</t>

<sourcecode>
    02 000d
      01 0003  g  i  f
      01 0004 61 62 63 64
</sourcecode>

</section>

<section>  <!-- 8.2.3 -->
  <name>List</name>

<t>This is represented as</t>

<sourcecode> <![CDATA[
    03 <length> <item1> <item2> <item3> ... <itemn> 00
]]> </sourcecode>

<t>For example, the list (abc [d]ef (g)) is represented in memory as
(with k=2)</t>

<sourcecode>
    03 001b
      01 0003 a b c
      02 0009
        01 0001 d
        01 0002 e f
      03 0005
        01 0001 g

<t>This note has described S-expressions in general form.  Application
writers may wish to restrict their use of S-expressions in various
ways.  Here are some possible restrictions that might be
considered:</t>

<ul>
<li>no display-hints</li>
<li>no lengths on hexadecimal, quoted-strings, or base-64 encodings</li>
<li>no empty lists</li>
<li>no empty octet-strings</li>
<li>no lists having another list as its first element</li>
<li>no base-64 or hexadecimal encodings</li>
<li>fixed limits on the size of octet-strings</li>

  <name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>As a pure data representation format, there are few security
considerations to S-expressions. A canonical form is required for the
reliable verification of digital signatures and this is provided in
<xref target="canonical"/>.</t>
